These are my Postman collections for the training of my own API Testing skills. In this case I have used the free Trello API.
You can download a postman_collection and postman_environment to run the collection locally on your computer in Postman importing a collection and an env.

This repository was created for the potential employers to show my examples of checklists, test cases, bug reports, SQL queries, Postman collections and test plans.
